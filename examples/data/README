About this example dataset:

1. This has been taken from the Asian Language Treebank dataset. (https://www2.nict.go.jp/astrec-att/member/mutiyama/ALT/)
2. The dataset contains 13 languages but I have only chosen 3.
3. The dataset is N-way parallel so the same sentence is available in all languages.
4. The dataset is split into train/dev/test sets containing 18,088, 1,000 and 1,018 lines respectively.
